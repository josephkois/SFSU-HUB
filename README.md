Executive Summary

Team 6 project is an all-in-one hub specially made for SFSU students to access a multitude of services through the University such as creating events to socialize with other students, joining events that are posted by faculty or other students, finding housing, posting advertisements for roommates or finding used books for sale. The application will also be designed for usability and simplicity in mind, as the SFSU website can oftentimes be cluttered. 

It is important because it gives students a dedicated place to find upperclassmen selling textbooks that they don’t need. Students don’t have to go to the bookstore to resell them and they can sell directly to another student, taking out the middleman and students could also sell notes from certain classes. It also helps with students or prospective students finding housing with other SFSU students, and looking for events outside of the SFSU events. The most important aspect of the application is that it is easy to use and access all these important social and academic aspects of University in one place.

The problem it solves is students wouldn't have to make many accounts on different websites or applications. Students would no longer have to go to forums like reddit, or advertising sites like Craigslist or Ebay to find housing or used textbooks. While simultaneously giving students a direct access to a dedicated page for school events, which can oftentimes be scattered through multiple discord servers, or multiple pages on the SFSU website.

In relation to competition, most other university applications are cluttered, unintuitive, and chaotic, with unrelated functionalities grouped together almost arbitrarily, making user experience for these apps almost unbearable. Also, most of these university systems only offer services and interfaces for course information and university resources, but lack any social or commercial aspect.

 Our product however, will be designed to have a simple, intuitive UI that enhances students' college experience, as its functionalities will be grouped logically with information displayed so users have no stressful experiences added to their already hard studies.
